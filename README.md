### Hi there, I'm Florian Oeser ğŸ‘‹
I made my childhood dream come true and landed a job in the gamedev industry :)

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on everything related to pipeline automation, build engineering and deployment orchestration

ğŸŒ± Teamcity enthusiast

âš¡ Fun fact: I always deploy directly to production. This saves testing time and gives you first-hand feedback, I promise ;-)
